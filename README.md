 Hello , Humans ! 
 
This project is a mini weather station based on Nokia 5110 lcd and DHT11 humidity & temperature sensor . The project works perfectly with  attached libraries  and I uploaded a jpg file with the project connections and the code created by me . 

- INSTRUCTIONS 

Click the "CLONE or DOWNLOAD" button in the top right corner, unzip the main archive and copy (after  unziping  libraries archives) the   libraries folders on C:\Users\ "YOUR PC NAME "\Documents\Arduino\libraries. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart Arduino IDE.
